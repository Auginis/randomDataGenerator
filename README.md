 # randomDataGenerator

This program generates random information based on user's input. It also has an ability to add custom strings to random data.

To use the application - simply launch it and select what kind of information you would like to get generated. "Advanced" button lets you create a custom string to add and the "Generate" button generates a "Results.txt" with randomized data.

For names and surnames database easier managment there is a premade Python counter script ("counter.py") in the "App_Data" folder which counts "Names.txt" and "Surnames.txt" items and writes the results into "count.txt".
