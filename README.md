 # randomDataGenerator

This program generates random information based on user's input. It also has an ability to add custom strings to random data.

To use the application - simply launch it (or go to jukna.tech/random-generator) and select what kind of information you would like to get generated. "Advanced" button lets you create a custom string to add and the "Generate" button generates a "Results.txt" with randomized data.
